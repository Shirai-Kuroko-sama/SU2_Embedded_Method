# SU2_Embedded_Method
An Embedded FIML method based on SU2(an open source CFD application)
## SU2嵌入式FIML方法
一种基于开源CFD软件SU2的流场反演与机器学习方法(Field inversion and machine learning,FIML)
## Abstract(摘要)
In this project, we propose a new FIML method based on the open source CFD application called SU2. (originaly founded by Juan J. Alonso,etc, Stanford University，and constructed by global teams or individuals. Original details may visit the link below:)

在本项目中，我们在开源CFD软件SU2的基础上提出了一个新的FIML方法(SU2由斯坦福大学Alonso等团队创始，并由世界各地团队或个体共同开发。SU2相关的源代码请访问以下链接：)

And professor J.Holland developed the SU2's FIML branch, initialized the frame of field inversion and machine learning method based on SU2, which is the main constuction and inspiration of this project. Original codes of FIML method in SU2 may visit the link below:

It's an all-known fact that nowadays RANS method have encountered many tackles As Prof.Holland
